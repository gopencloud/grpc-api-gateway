# Installation

Currently, there's only one option: build from source. Ready-to-use binaries for different platforms can be added later in Releases page if demanded.

## Install from Source

```sh
go install github.com/gopencloud/grpc-api-gateway/codegen/cmd/protoc-gen-openapiv3@latest
go install github.com/gopencloud/grpc-api-gateway/codegen/cmd/protoc-gen-grpc-api-gateway@latest
```

To retrieve the specific version, replace `latest` with `<version>`.
